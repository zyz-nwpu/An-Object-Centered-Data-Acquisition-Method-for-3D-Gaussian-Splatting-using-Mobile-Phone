# An Object-Centered Data Acquisition Method for 3D Gaussian Splatting using Mobile Phone

---

## 🔔 News
- **[2025-10]** Initial release with demo videos and Android capture APK.  
- Source code and detailed documentation will be made publicly available soon.

---

## 📘 Overview
This work presents a **mobile object-centered data acquisition method** tailored to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  
It introduces an **on-device, real-time guided capture** process that leverages IMU-based orientation sensing, spherical coverage feedback, and stability gating to ensure consistent and uniform multiview data collection for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.

## 🧪 Experimental Setup
- **Device:** Redmi K70 Pro (with angle logging and stability gating)  
- **Reconstruction:** 3D Gaussian Splatting on NVIDIA RTX 5090D
